# Docker Molecule

This is container that has [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) installed. It can be used to test and run Ansible playbooks/roles/collections etc.

## Requirements

To run this locally, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) will need to be installed.

## Notes

The [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file contains all of the needed dependencies. Also this only installs `ansible-core` and not `ansible`.
